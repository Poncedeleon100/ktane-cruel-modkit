                <h2>On the Subject of AV-Input</h2>
                <p class="flavour-text">Audio Visual. That’s what it stands for. Anything else is pure coincidence.</p>
                <p><strong>Note: </strong>If your module’s components aren’t exactly <strong>[Piano, Bulbs]</strong>, you are looking at the wrong section of this manual!</p>
                <p>Each bulb will switch its light state (on to off and vice versa) when the piano key pressed is part of a certain five-note scale chosen for that bulb.
                    Any other key not part of the scale chosen will either turn it on (or do nothing when it’s already on) or turn it off (or do nothing when it’s already off).</p>
                <p>Each key cannot be pressed twice in a row. Doing so will yield a strike immediately and switch off both bulbs.</p>
                <p>When ready, unscrew a bulb, then press the five piano keys in any order that make up the scale chosen for that bulb, then screw the bulb back in.
                    A strike will be given upon screwing the bulb when an incorrect scale is inputted. Otherwise, the bulb will remain deactivated, and stay off upon any input from the piano.</p>
                <p>Deactivate the two bulbs to solve the module.</p>
                <p>The I/O buttons function to turn both light bulbs off and disregard the last piano key pressed, effectively functioning as reset buttons.
                    However, they can only be used after each piano key has been pressed at least once. If the last piano key pressed is a white key, use the I button.
                    Otherwise, use the O button. Pressing the wrong button will strike and not reset the module.</p>
