The current progress is tracked via a [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ISm4llmEhFaxU_DYh7ByeiE_S4cTfl4Mh4BnJ3HAOOo/edit?gid=154357339#gid=154357339).

## Rules for Git collaboration

**PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING BEFORE STARTING TO DEVELOP ANYTHING**

Since this project will be worked on by multiple people, please follow the following rules :

- DO NOT push directly into the main branch. DO create a new branch for every new implementation.
  - Hotfixes can be made directly into the main branch, but please be careful when doing so.
- Once you're done with developping, create a Pull Request to merge your work to the main branch.
- DO NOT merge it yourself. DO wait for someone else to review your code, test it, and determine whether or not the person's work is good enough to be merged.
   - You can ping developpers in the Discord server to notify them you've opened a PR.
   - Kudos if you notice ways to factorize/optimize code!

Happy coding!
